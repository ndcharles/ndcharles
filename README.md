# Ndidi Charles Nweke (@ndcharles)

I am currently a data scientist, a journey which has been awesome so far🙌. My interests are in real-life applications of data science/Machine Learning.

## Fun fact
<!-- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Cheta](https://cheta.com.ng)<br>
Cheta is a project born out of my classroom experience. After leaving the classroom, I was still a home lesson teacher for a while. It was then that I realised how difficult it is to help kids practice for common entrance examinations (NCEE). This is me trying to build something for myself using my knowledge of WordPress.<br>

🔭 I’m currently working on Stopeet! A search platform to help detect fake job locations.
